# KringleCon2
KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves!

Hosted by Santa and his team at the North Pole in mid-December 2019, security-minded people and hackers from around the world will come together virtually to help improve the state of cyber security world-wide, protecting Christmas and all other holidays from dastardly cyber attackers.

For the 2019 SANS holiday hack challenge, @d4v3c0d3r and me, @4lexa, have decided to work together and save Christmas! We hope you can enjoy our write up...:)
